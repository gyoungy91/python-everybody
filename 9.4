# 9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

# My code prints correct email address, but doubles the count
# MY Output = cwen@iupui.edu 10 
# Desired output = cwen@iupui.edu 5

name = input("Enter file:")

emails = dict()
for line in handle:
    if not line.startswith('From'): continue
    sender = line.split()
    sender = sender[1]
    emails[sender] = emails.get(sender,0) + 1

emailaddress = None
emailcount = None

for email,count in emails.items():
    if emailcount is None or count > emailcount:
        emailaddress = email
        emailcount = count
